## Some notes 

The colabs are done by myself and meet the task requirements. I haven't got an official answer yet, so they may not provide the optimal solutions and there is still a lot of room for optimization.

Slides and colabs continue to be updated with my learning process.

If there exists any infringement, please contact me and I will delete the file as soon as possible.
